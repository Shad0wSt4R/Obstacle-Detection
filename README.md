## Prerequisites 
Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos

Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip

Keras: https://keras.io/#installation

## Installation
After installing the prerequisites, download the entire program. Using the Anaconda Navigator, launch the Spyder application, and load the program through the application.

## Description
The program uses deep learning to train a machine to recognize vehicles in pre recorded videos using a Quasi Newton algorithm. Using OpenCV, the video is processed frame by frame. Each frame is first converted to grayscale and chopped into sections which are then analyzed by a neural network by pixel to classify the pixels based on color. In the program, there is 1 hidden layer using 130 nodes.
